Web Page With Make and M4

With wpwmm4 can create web pages with simply 'make' and 'm4'.

Requirements:
- make (BSD's make, use bmake package of your distro)
- m4 (compatible with BSD's m4 and GNU's m4 too)
- some knowledge about HTML and programming

Features:
- incremental build (with make)
- automatically generated pages (similar webpage with different content)
- layouts
- expandable, programmable via m4 or can insert output of any program

Nutshell:
- convert items of ${TARGETS}: ${SRC_DIR}/*.m4 -> ${DEST_DIR}/*.html
- create items of ${TARGETS_MANUAL}: use own programs, scripts
- create items of ${VIRTUALS}: use templates from ${VIRT_DIR}
- can call scripts from scripts/ directory and use their outputs
